<b> Bank Statement Analyzer </b>

This project is inspired from the book "Real-World Software Development" by Raoul-Gabriel Urma & Richard Warburton.

This is Version 1.0 of the project, it looks very similar to the project in the book. 

run in src directory with the commands:
javac Application.java
java Application [file-name].csv (place csv file in resorces folder)

However, my own implementation with a GUI is coming soon...
